# Project-Portfolio
A portfolio of my progress and projects in my Applied Programming class.

# Overview

This is a simple python program that prints the words "Hello world!" to the terminal screen. I demonstrated the use of assigning string values to variables and utilizing said variables in functions and format strings.


My purpose in creating this software is to provide a basic example of the functionality of the python programming language, and demonstrate a beginner-friendly means of utilizing that functionality.
